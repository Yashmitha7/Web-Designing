     <h2>The Boy Who Lived.</h2> 
     <p>
        Harry James Potter was an English half-blood wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort, the most powerful and feared dark wizard in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the Potter family to go into hiding.
